# ADR-001: Adoption of Clean Architecture Pattern

* Status: Accepted
* Date: 2024-01-15
* Authors: Goutam Kumar Biswas
* Deciders: Technical Leadership

## Context

The hotel reviews microservice needs a well-structured architecture that:
- Separates business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Enables independent testing of business rules
- Supports multiple data sources and external integrations
- Facilitates maintenance and future extensions
- Provides clear dependency boundaries

The team evaluated several architectural patterns including layered architecture, hexagonal architecture, and clean architecture.

## Decision

We will adopt Clean Architecture (as defined by Robert C. Martin) with the following layers:
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, business rules, and interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, handlers, and application-specific logic  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (database, HTTP, S3, etc.)

Directory structure:
```
internal/
├── domain/         # Domain entities, services, interfaces
├── application/    # Handlers, middleware, use cases
└── infrastructure/ # Database, external services, adapters
```

## Rationale

**Benefits of Clean Architecture:**
- **Dependency Inversion**: Infrastructure depends on domain, not vice versa
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested without external dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., database providers)
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces coupling
- **Framework Independence**: Business rules don't depend on web frameworks

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Layered Architecture**: Rejected due to potential for circular dependencies
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Similar benefits but less prescriptive structure
- **Monolithic Structure**: Rejected due to poor maintainability at scale

**Trade-offs:**
- Initial development complexity is higher
- More files and interfaces to manage
- Learning curve for developers new to the pattern

## Consequences

### Positive
- Business logic is isolated and easily testable
- Infrastructure changes don't affect business rules
- Clear boundaries prevent architectural drift
- Enables comprehensive unit testing without mocks for external systems
- Supports multiple delivery mechanisms (HTTP, gRPC, CLI)

### Negative
- More boilerplate code and interfaces
- Higher initial development time
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries
- Can feel over-engineered for simple operations

### Neutral
- Development teams need training on clean architecture principles
- Code reviews must enforce architectural boundaries
- New dependency injection patterns required

## Implementation

### Key Implementation Steps:
1. ✅ Define domain entities and interfaces in `internal/domain/`
2. ✅ Implement application handlers in `internal/application/`
3. ✅ Create infrastructure adapters in `internal/infrastructure/`
4. ✅ Establish dependency injection in main application
5. ✅ Implement comprehensive testing strategy for each layer

### Architectural Rules:
- Domain layer has no external dependencies
- Application layer can depend on domain but not infrastructure
- Infrastructure layer implements domain interfaces
- Dependency injection flows from main → infrastructure → application → domain

### Testing Strategy:
- **Domain**: Pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- **Application**: Tests with mocked infrastructure dependencies
- **Infrastructure**: Integration tests with real external systems

- [ADR-004](004-error-handling-strategy.md): Error handling across layers

## Notes

This decision was influenced by:
- Team experience with monolithic architectures becoming hard to maintain
- Need for comprehensive testing without complex test setup
- Requirements for multiple data source support (S3, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Desire to enable future microservice decomposition

The implementation follows the principles outlined in "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin and "Architecture Patterns with Python" by Harry Percival and Bob Gregory.
